GoConvey is a 2-pronged project:

- A package you import in your test code that allows you to write BDD-style tests.
- An executable that runs a local web server which displays auto-updating test results in a web browser.

We've spent significant time at SmartyStreets building GoConvey and it has perfectly met (and exceeded) all of our initial design specifications We've used it to great effect. Being so well-matched to our development workflows at SmartyStreets, we haven't had a need to hack on it lately. This had been frustrating to the community who have ideas for the project and would like to see new features (and some old bugs fixed). The release of Go 1.5 and the new vendoring experiment has been a source of confusion and hassle for those who have already upgraded and find that GoConvey needs to be brought up to speed.

So, we'd like to open the project up to additional contributors who want to move the project forward in a meaningful way.

**Comment on [this issue](https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/issues/329) if you're interested. Preference will be given to those that have already contributed to the project. Checkout the issues listing if you'd like to become a contributor.**

_(I should mention that the [assertions](https://github.com/smartystreets/assertions) package imported by the convey package is used by other projects at SmartyStreets and so we will be continuing to maintain that project internally.)_
